# Front-End Site

In Stage 1.1, I set up the frontend of my application using Vite and organized my components into functional, reusable pieces. I implemented the essential routes, designed the layout with responsive techniques like flex and grid, and followed the BEM methodology for CSS class naming. In Stage 1.2, I connected the app to a third-party API, using fetch to make GET and POST requests while handling API errors and dynamically displaying data in the UI. I showed a preloader during data fetching, and implemented a "Show more" button to load additional content. I used local storage to maintain state between visits, and simulated the "Save" button functionality for now.
